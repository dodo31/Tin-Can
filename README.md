We were 3 on the project:
 * **DrawRunner** (myself) had to implementa the base gameplay (food chain, entities life-cycle etc.) as well as to design UI and integrate and assets
 * **Hiku** was in charge of level design (eggs temporization, spaceship speed etc.), UI implementation and collisions management optimization (which was critical for our game)
 * **Kastaff** had the role to create every visual and audio assets, such as entity sprites, full map and background music (he had never made any song before)
