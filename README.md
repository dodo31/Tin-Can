We were 3 on the project:
 * DrawRunner (myself) had to implementa the base gameplay (food chain, entities life-cycle etc.) as well as UI design and assets integration
 * Hiku was in charge of level design (eggs temporization, spaceship speed etc.), UI implementation as well as collisions management and optimisation (which was critical for our game)
 * Kastaff had the role to create every visual and audio assets, such as entity sprites, map and background music (he had never made any song before)
